# RangL reference environment

## Overview

The `env_dev` folder contains the environment used in the competition. To modify it for development purposes, check out its `README`.

Modified environments can be checked using the `test_reference_environment_direct_deployment.py` script. This will
* Run logical tests, which
    * validate that the environment is correctly specified
    * illustrate useful concepts such as random seeding
* Run a rule-based agent and create a plot `fixed_policy_DirectDeployment.png` of the episode
